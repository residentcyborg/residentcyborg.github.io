<p>Hi, I'm a free-time programmer and you've stumbled upon my page. I'm working on Forth-like systems among other things which you can see <a href="https://github.com/sandras-simanauskas">here</a>. If you like my work, email me at sandras.simanauskas[at]gmail.com.<p>

<p>I'm thinking of starting a linux distribution. The idea would be to keep it simple in a standards-following way, but also hand-pick simplest possible software for every task, and ofcourse learn a lot in the process.</p>
