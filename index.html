<p>Hi, I'm a free-time programmer and you've stumbled upon my page. I'm working on Forth-like systems among other things which you can see <a href="https://github.com/sandras-simanauskas">here</a>.
</p>

<p>I'm thinking of starting a Linux distribution. The idea would be to keep it simple in a standards-following way, but also hand-pick simplest possible software for every task, maybe see what I can do with static linking, and of course learn a lot in the process
</p>

<p>Another idea is to write a Forth-like OS. To build an OS I must first define the core principles:
<ul>
  <li>Simple, small, fast;</li>
  <li>Ubiquitous - portable, self-hosting, independent of platforms or their features (for example Virtual Memory Management), minimal dependencies for building from another OS, able to run natively on hardware or as a guest on top of another OS (see <a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/">Inferno</a>);</li>
  <li>Deterministic achieved by no scheduling, no caching, static memory allocation (see <a href="http://www.fudgeos.com/">Fudge</a>);</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I like public Public Domain.</p>
