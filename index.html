<p>Hi, I'm a free-time programmer and you've stumbled upon my page. I'm working on Forth-like systems among other things which you can see <a href="https://github.com/sandras-simanauskas">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of starting a Linux distribution. The idea would be to keep it simple in a standards-following way, but also hand-pick simplest possible software for every task, maybe see what I can do with static linking, and of course learn a lot in the process.</p>

<p>Another idea is to write a Forth-like OS:
<ul>
  <li>Simple, lightweight, fast;</li>
  <li>Self hosting, portable;</li>
  <li>Able to run natively on hardware or as a guest on top of another OS;</li>
  <li>Determinism achieved by one task per core, no caching, and static memory allocation (see <a href="http://www.fudgeos.com/">Fudge</a>);</li>
  <li>Minimal dependencies for building from Unix.</li>
</ul></p>
